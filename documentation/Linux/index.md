* Windows has multiple root file for each drive, i.e different for each drive (C:, D:, E:)
* In windows, each new harddrive or other additioal drives like cd drive and pendrives has their own root file system, i.e different file trees for each drives
* But in Linux, there is only one root folder and everything that ubuntu needs to run lies inside folders and files below that root folder
* Everything is a FILE in linux
* Each new device or drives added is mounted to some folder inside that root directory
* All dir except homw needs root permission
* Ctrl+H :- show and unshow hidden files
