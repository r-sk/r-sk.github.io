# Introduction

# Perception

* Analyze ego motion and ourself
* Inludes two things:
    * identification of objects in surrounding
    * understanding their motion
* Why? := helps to take fuether decision
  
## Goals of Perception
* Static and dynamic objects detection and their motion prediction
* Ego localization

## Static objects
* Road and lane markings (on-road)
* Construction signs, obstructions (on-road)
* Curbs (off-road)
* Traffic lights (off-road)
* Road signs (off-road)

## Dynamics objects
* Vehicles (on-road)
* Pedestrian (on-road)

## Ego localization
* Position
* Velocity, acceleration
* Orientation, angular motion

## Challenges to perception
* Robust detection and segmentation
* Sensor uncertainty
* Occlusion, reflection
* Illumination, lens flare
* Weather, precipitation

* Also can be said as: Driving Decision, Action
